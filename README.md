# Radio-Altimeter

A Radio-Altimeter that is functional via slides/a power checkbox, made with React.

Note: The requirements and the instructional video varied in terms of behaviour. As of such I decided to follow the instructions behaviour instead of the video. Also of note: I assumed that the instruction ‘The needle has transitioned from above the bug to below it.’ to mean that that needle (or altitude) has a lower value compared to the bug(in order to turn on the light when the power is on).
